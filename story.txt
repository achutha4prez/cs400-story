The very exhausted CS 400 student, Achutha Balaji, stands idly in the Hector F. DeLuca 
Biochemistry Building. He is waiting for the ongoing lecture to end so he can go inside and 
sit on one of those comfy chairs. Although AVL Trees are something Achutha is passionate 
about, he cannot help but dose off since he only slept for four hours. When he finally wakes 
up, he is saddened by the realization that the professor is not talking about AVL Trees 
anymore, but instead moving on to the inferior Red-Black Trees.
"Why red and black?" Achutha wondered. "What's wrong with blue or green?"
