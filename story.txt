The very exhausted CS 400 student, Achutha Balaji, stands idly in the Hector F. DeLuca Biochemistry Building. He is waiting for the ongoing lecture to end so
he can go inside and sit on one of those comfy chairs. Although AVL Trees are something Achutha is passionate about, he cannot help but dose off since he only
slept for four hours. When he finally wakes up, he is saddened by the realization that the professor is not talking about AVL Trees anymore, but instead moving 
on to the inferior Red-Black Trees.

He is very disappointed that so little time was spent on AVL Trees, although he is not really sure how long was spent on them, since he was sleeping for the majority of the last few lectures. He is unhappy that his mind is currently being infiltrated by various cases red property violations, so he decides to close his eyes once more.
